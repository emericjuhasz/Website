          <h2>About:</h2>
          <p>My name is Emeric, and I was born in Bellflower, CA. My parents were both
             born in Romania and imgrated to US in the 1980. Growing up, technology was
             not a big push growing up but always was interesting to me. Took my first
             computer class in 7th grade which got me hooked to IT. Week after high school,
             joined the military where I got my training with tech. Recent years, writing
             code has becomming a interest. During Covid I had some more free time as I was not comuting
             over 1.5hr a day.</p>
